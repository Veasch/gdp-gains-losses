## Background

This is my first R-script that is directly linked to GitHub. My objective for this project is to replicate an [interactive graph](https://www.fusioncharts.com/demos/datastories/jobs-gain-and-loss/) that tracks the number of sectors gaining or losing jobs over time. I find this graph very particularly fascinating.

Over the next few days or weeks, I plan to create a similar interactive graph, but this time using international data on [GDP changes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fredericksalazar/pib-gdp-global-by-countries-since-1960-to-2021?resource=download) by different regions since 1960 to 2021.

## About the data

Let's begin by taking a look at the raw data.

```{r message=FALSE}
gdp_data <- paste0(getwd(), "/data/countries_gdp_hist.csv") |> 
  read_csv2()

glimpse(gdp_data)
```
